      <description>As promised, I'm back to let you know how it went. You were kinda right, had I attempted to face down my kief blunt it would have been a waste, but not because it burned too fast. It burned really slow actually, it just became impossible to hit after a while. So I unwrapped it to take a look, and it was pretty much just a solid tube. So I broke up those pieces and put them into my bong, and omg wow, one hit obliterated me (I still have a bunch left over). The blunt tasted *really* good though, burned super smooth. I kind of imagined it would just go up in flames like a shake jay or something. So, I've learned my lesson, for maximum kief enjoyment: press it, then smoke it in something that provides maximum air flow. [2]</description>

      <description>[6] TIL why you can't roll a kief blunt, contrary to popular opinion it's not because it burns to fast (burns quite slow actually). About 3/4 of the way through I couldn't pull it normally anymore. I started taking hits off the head, even flipped it around and smoked right off the cherry, eventually I gave up and decided to put what's left in the bong. I unwrapped it and it's just a solid piece of blunt shaped kief, can't pull through that. So in the bolw it's going.</description>

      <description>In practice I've found you don't get that much of a deal, depending on where your source is in the supply chain their profit margins can be very small. So for example, if someone is selling 8ths for $50, they might give you an oz for $350. If they're paying $300 to $325 an oz then they're barely making any money at that point.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said that no previous studies had found a link between marijuana and the disease. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;So.. This is the only study that says anything about the link...? They say a little further down that it's the first study. Further, they admit that the sample size was too small to indicate anything other than the fact that more study was needed. Being skeptical is good, particularly in this area, but at least be skeptical for the right reasons.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt;&amp;quot;This is consistent with the study's findings that the elevated risk of nonseminoma-type testicular cancer in particular was associated with marijuana use prior to 18&amp;quot; There's a good a reason as any I've ever heard not to start smoking until you're older.</description>
